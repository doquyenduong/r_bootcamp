# R-bootcamp 

This is a pair project for the module "R-bootcamp" at HSLU. It's my first project ever with R. 

## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENT
- Find a use case that comes with some data
- The choice of the case is completely up to you
- The dataset must contain at least a few hundred observations and a dozen variables
- among the variables there must be numeric and categorical ones
- the dataset should also contain variables that are dates or geographic locations (both is even better)
- A chapter of your choice: we want you to use a package that was not mentioned in the course and perform a task that was not directly discussed in the course. Be creative!
- Fit model(s):Note that the focus of this course is not modelling. Therefore, do not invest time in finding fancy models. A very simple model will do it.
- Dynamic documents and reproducibility: We want you to create the pdf/html document with Rmarkdown. Make sure that your analysis is fully
reproducible and comprehensible for anyone reading it.
- Comments: The analysis needs to be commented. Keep in mind that you should make up a story to tell to a client. So, we want you to comment what you are doing and why you are doing things.
